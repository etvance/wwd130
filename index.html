        <p>    My name is Elijah Vance, I am from a small town in weastern New York just 10 minues away from Palmyra. I am currently put down for Chemical Engeneering, but I am in the process of swapping to Computer Science. Some things that I enjoy doing include Hanging out with friends, playing games(Physical and Electronic), and playing and listening to music.
            If you couldn't tell from my picture I also model part time*, but only on my good days.<br><br>
               My favorite scripture changes frequently, but as of right now it's probably WoM verse 7 "And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.<br>
            <br>
            *Disclaimer: I am not actually a Model nor do I intend to, that was purely for comedic effect. Please do not contact me for your modeling needs.*
